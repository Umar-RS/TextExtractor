 THG sued  Oliver Cookson  over the sale of Myprotein in 2011. Cookson was sued for £15 million, with THG claiming overestimation affected the valuation of the company when they bought it. Cookson counter sued for £12.7 million claiming a breach of warranty and fraudulent mis-representation. The matter went to the High Court in London in October 2014 and after a month-long trial judgement was given by  William Blair  in November 2014 giving Oliver Cookson an overall net result win of £6.5m in damages. [52] [53] 
 At the costs hearing in December 2014, the judge awarded a payment of just under £7.5 million to be made by THG to Cookson and the Trust in respect of all of the claims and counterclaims in the action and one third of the costs incurred by Mr Cookson and the Trust. [54] 
 Oliver Cookson and the Trust appealed the court's decision to award The Hut Groups damages. [55]  The court of appeal dismissed the appeal on 22 March 2016. [56]
